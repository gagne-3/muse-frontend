# Muse Compose Manager (Frontend)

Muse is a Docker Compose Manager written with Next.js and python. This repository is for frontend component of the Muse stack.

## What is Muse

Muse is focused on being simple and non-opinionated. The goal is to provide a UI that allows for creation and management of Docker Compose stacks without locking you into anything.

Docker Compose files are kept on the base server. You can edit, add, modify all you want. You can manage your docker compose files however you want. Muse is simply an option to manage docker compose if you don't want to use the command line.

To put it simply(ish?), Muse is an abstraction of the existing Docker Compose workflow, simply providing a pretty face to the basic terminal commands.

## A Fair Warning

__I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I AM DOING__

I am __not__ a web developer, I am __not__ a computer scientist, I am __not__ a programmer.

I am a plain old mechanical engineer who happens to like messing around with my homelab.

The most formal education I have ever had with web development is basic HTML and CSS, and even that was pre HTML 5. I have experience in Java, but I have very little knowledge of JavaScript, let alone any frameworks or anything.

This project got started by me following along with Next.js tutorials on YouTube.

If you ever see something and wonder, "Boy, that's stupid, why would you do that?", the answer is that I have no idea what I am doing. I am meerly a chimpanzee with a hammer and some ideas.

Please be patient with me. Any and all feedback is appreciated. Again: __I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I AM DOING__
